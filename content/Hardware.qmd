## Towed Array

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

#### What are Towed Arrays?
Towed arrays consist of an array of hydrophones connected to a long electronic cable dragged behind a vessel. This method or acoustic recording is a powerful survey method as it can be paired with visual observer data, enabling new acoustic sounds to be ground-truthed with the sound source.

## Glider

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

#### What are Gliders?
Gliders are autonomous underwater vehicles that are pre-programmed to travel a given path collecting acoustic and ancillary data. There are two primary types of gliders: Battery-powered (capabilities of traveling at varying depths in the water column) or wave-powered (powered by the motion of the waves)

## Moored Recorders

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

#### What are Moored Recorders?
Moored Recording devices record continuous acoustic data in a stationary location. There are multiple types of moored recorders, including Soundtraps, HARPs(High-Frequency Acoustic Recording Package), PALs, and EARs.

## Drifting Acoustic Recorders

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="55%"}

#### What are Drifting Acoustic Recorders?
Drifting Acoustic Recorders are recording devices designed to drift at sea for long periods of time. This acoustic sampling method utilizes oceanic currents to carry these drifting buoys long distances.

## Sonobuoys
:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

#### What are Sonobuoys?
Sonobuoys serve as disposable floating acoustic recording devices. These disposable recorders transmit real-time underwater acoustics via radio transmission, which is beneficial to record acoustics in a location free of vessel presence. Sonobuoys can be deployed via aircraft or boat, and are primarily used by the navy.

## Biologging Recorders

:::::::::::::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

#### What are Biologging Recorders?
Dtags, or Acoustic and Dive Behavior Tags, are powerful acoustic recording devices deployed directly on an animal. Dtags are deployed directly by researchers using long poles or drones, and tags remain on the animal using suction cups. Varying Dtag models collect a variety of acoustic, geographic tracking, and ancillary data (depth, temperature, salinity, etc.), allowing researchers to understand acoustic and dive behaviors.
