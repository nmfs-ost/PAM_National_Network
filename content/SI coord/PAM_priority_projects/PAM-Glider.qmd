Erin Oleson (PIFSC), Shannon Rankin (SWFSC)

### Goal

Develop a Research to Operations plan intended to serve all regions to integrate PAM gliders into assessment missions, reducing ship-time needs.

## PAM-Glider National Roadmap

### 1. Identify & Test Technology

#### *Build Capacity*

Develop and expand PAM-Glider capacity at SWFSC and PIFSC including diversification of platforms and acoustic processors for diversification, to reduce risk, and to encourage competitive technological advancement.

#### *Testing*

Field testing is occurring as new PAM-gliders are procured ([updates](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/gliderRodeo.html)). A multi-platform comparative sea trial is tentatively planned for FY26 and will provide a means of comparing the utility of various platforms to address different research questions and environmental conditions.

### 2. Concurrent Glider/Ship Surveys

#### *US West Coast CalCurCEAS*

PAM-Gliders may provide cost effective alternatives to seasonal shipboard surveys. We collaborated with Oregon State University to deploy three PAM-gliders off the coast of Oregon. This survey coincided with the periodic CalCurCEAS surveys (conducted once every 5 years) and will provide data to develop downstream methods to assess marine mammal stocks (see [PAM-SI Stock Assessment Projects](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_National_Network/content/SI%20coord/PAM_priority_projects/Stock_projects/Project_1.html)).

#### *Hawaii HICEAS*

A similar survey will be conducted in early 2026, concurrent with the HICEAS survey in Hawaiian waters. This will serve as a proof of concept and provide critical comparative data for developing stock assessment models.

### 3. Advanced Data Analysis

Data collected during the US West Coast surveys will be used by the PAM-SI Stock Assessment team to develop methods for using PAM Glider data for stock assessment models.

### 4. Field Test Ecosystem Studies (UxS funded "Plankton to Whales")

The "Plankton to Whales" (P2W) project is a collaborative project between the PAM-SI and the UxS (uncrewed systems) and Optics Strategic Initiatives. The P2W project transitions PAM-equipped gliders and Shadowgraph-equipped gliders to operational ecological surveys. P2W surveys will begin when after testing of these systems (as soon as summer 2025).

### 5. Transition to Operations Plan --\> National Roadmap

We are updating developments through our [PAM-Glider site](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/) and the results of each of these components will result in a [Transition to Operations](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM-Glider/content/transitionPlan.html) plan. In addition to serving as a research to operations plan for the US West Coast and Hawaii, it will serve as a National Strategy RoadMap for PAM-Glider operations.
