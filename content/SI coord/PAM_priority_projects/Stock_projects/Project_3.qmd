### Team leads
Yvonne Barkey (PIFSC), Melissa Soldevilla (SEFSC), Annamaria DeAngelis (NEFSC), Jennifer McCullough (PIFSC)

### Target Outcome
Expanding the utility of an existing automated tracking and localization tool to facilitate distance sampling-based density estimation from towed array surveys for sperm and beaked whales.

### Summary
Towed hydrophone arrays are a standard part of NMFS line-transect surveys. Oftentimes acoustic detection of species far out-numbers visual detections, such that inclusion of acoustically detected groups could increase the precision and accuracy of density analyses and improve stock assessments. PIFSC has developed an automated multi-target tracking tool for identification, tracking, and localization of false killer whale subgroups that can be adapted for use with other species. Current methods for density estimation using towed array acoustic detections of sperm whales and beaked whales are time-consuming and use of automated tracking and localization tools would increase efficiency and therefore utility of these datasets to improve the stock assessments for these species. This project will improve functionality of the existing multi-target tracking tool that is used by PIFSC to extract perpendicular distance information from data to support density and abundance estimation. Work will include testing, modifying, and validating the tool on sperm whale and beaked whale datasets from multiple regions (NEFSC, SEFSC). The outcome of this project would support the PAM SI objective of data integration to support stock assessments by advancing the technology readiness of PAM inclusion in Stock Assessment Reports in multiple NOAA Fisheries regions.

### Action Items
1. **Identify challenges:** Yvonne and Jen work with Pina Gruden to understand what modifications to the current code are necessary for use for sperm whales and beaked whales, providing an estimate of the expected investment required to adapt the tool.

2. **Confer with PAM SI Working Group:** Working Group determines whether there is substantial interest and priority for continued pursuit of this project. If no-go, determine whether the project may be re-evaluated later based on funds available. Note: As of May 2024, this project was not selected for funding based on the outcomes of the consultation with the tool developer, Pina Gruden. Specifically, the time and amount of resources required are beyond the scope of the PAM SI.

3. **Prepare test datasets:** Gather test datasets from NE/SE/PI. 

4. **Training on Multi-target tracking tool:** Yvonne and Pina will train others on executing the tool in MATLAB. 

5. **Test cases:** Basic assessment of the tool on NE and SE datasets to identify bugs. 

6. **Resolve bugs:** Pina or others address usability needs of all users. 

7. **Aspirational step to improve tool:** If time and capacity allows, consider attempting to integrate depth estimation for more accurate horizontal distance estimation for deep divers based on Yvonne/Annamariaâ€™s work.


## Accomplishments
1. Devin and Janelle awarded funding from NMFS Science & Technology International Fellowship to travel to Univ. of St. Andrews for 2 weeks with CREEM folks (Len, Danielle, Tiago) to work on statistical methods 
2. This analysis team met 2 weeks ago to start the statistical development for integrating acoustic data into SDMs for towed arrays, so initial thinking is underway!
3. Data collection underway
