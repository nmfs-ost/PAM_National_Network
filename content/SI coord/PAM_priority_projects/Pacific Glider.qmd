### Team Leads 
Erin Oleson (PIFSC), Shannon Rankin (SWFSC)

### Goal
Develop R2O plan intended to serve all regions to integrate PAM gliders into assessment missions, reducing shiptime needs.

## PAM-Glider National Roadmap


### 1. Identify & Test Technology

#### Build Capacity

* Accomplishments
  + PIFSC: 2 @ Seagliders, Glider Lab
  + SWFSC: 2 @ Slocum, 2 @ Hefring Ocean Scout
  + Expand DMON (expected by end of FY26)

* Next steps
  + Test!
  
#### Glider Rodeo

* Accomplishments
  + Alseamar Contract Awarded (data as a service for Glider Rodeo)
  + Presentations at UG2 (Underwater Glider User Group, Erik Norris)
  + [Glider Reseo Repo/Website](https://nmfs-pam-glider.github.io/GliderRodeo/)
  
* Next steps
  + [Standardized Metrics for Comparison](https://nmfs-pam-glider.github.io/GliderRodeo/content/contactUs.html)
  + Schedule/Plan Survey (Fall 2025 West Coast, Feb 2026 Hawaii)

### 2. Concurrent Glider/Ship Surveys

#### US West Coast CalCurCEAS

* Accomplishments
  + Partner with OSU: 3 Seagliders off Oregon
  + [Access to real time maps/metadata](https://noaaosu.seaglider.pub/)

* Next steps
  + Survey data to Stock Assessment Team
  + Hawaii Survey (Feb 2026)
  
### 3. Advanced Data Analysis
Link our data with other teams (in process)

### 4. Field Test Ecosystem Studies (UxS funded "Plankton to Whales")
Postponed until SWFSC has PAM-Gliders

### 5. Transition to Operations Plan --> National Roadmap
* [PAM-Glider Github Organization](https://github.com/NMFS-PAM-Glider)
* Repositories 
  + [Glider Rodeo](https://nmfs-pam-glider.github.io/GliderRodeo/)
  + [Glider-CalCurCEAS](https://github.com/NMFS-PAM-Glider/glider-CalCurCEAS)
  + [PAM-UxS](https://nmfs-pam-glider.github.io/PAM-UxS/)
