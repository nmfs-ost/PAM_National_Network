## Overview

This page serves as a landing page to coordinate progress towards the Passive Acoustic Monitoring Strategic Initiative (PAM SI). Included below are important links to identify open action items, review priority project descriptions and working group meeting notes, as well as track progress and issues through GitHub projects.

The PAM SI Team has identified eight priority projects that combined work towards two overarching goals: (1) National Data & Analysis Integration and (2) Infrastructure Development & Efficiency. Progress towards these goals will implement transformational activities that will significantly change the way in which we collect, analyze, and make PAM data accessible for answering mission critical questions.
