    "text": "NOAA Fisheries’ PAM programs collect underwater sound recordings of the marine environment. Identification of the sounds produced by protected marine mammal species, fishes, humans, or the environment allows for an understanding of marine soundscapes and provides information on changes in species distribution, behavior and/or density. The technological revolution in PAM over the past decade has allowed both acoustic recorders and analytical approaches to increasingly become an integral part of NOAA Fisheries core science mission. PAM’s capacity for creating long term time series makes it an ideal approach for evaluating changes in species stocks, ecosystem interactions, and climate change.\nThere are seven NOAA Fisheries PAM programs including each regional Science Center and the Office of Science & Technology’s Ocean Acoustic Program. This repository serves to enhance National PAM collaboration within NOAA Fisheries and our partners through a common GitHub structure. Each of the regional science centers is in the process of establishing a region specific landing page that mimics the structure of this National page.",

    "text": "This is a template for a simple Quarto website (type: website). It looks like a html book (type: book) but unlike the book type it only has html format and you will not have the download options. type: website is a common format for documentation.\nThe repo includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The webpage will use the gh-pages branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.\nWarning: Check that the settings will allow the GitHub Action to run. See the instructions below under “GitHub Set-up”. Scroll down to the troubleshooting section if the website is not built by the GitHub Action.\nNote: The GitHub Action installs R so you can render qmd files with R code. You will need to edit to install Python or Julia if your qmd uses those instead. If you have substantial computations, you don’t want to be re-running all the computations for files that didn’t change. Read about the freeze option for this situation. R users with complex reports with dependencies (so qmd B depends on qmd A or data file A) should be aware of the {targets} package which will help you keep track of files that need to be re-rendered due to changes in dependencies.\n\n\n\nClick the green “Use This Template” button to make a repository with this content. Make sure to make your repo public (since GitHub Pages doesn’t work on private repos unless you have a paid account) and check box to include all the branches (so that you get the gh-pages branch). \nTurn on GitHub Pages under Settings &gt; Pages . You will set pages to be made from the gh-pages branch and root directory. \nAllow GitHub Actions under Settings &gt; Actions &gt; General \nAllow GitHub Actions to write to the gh-pages branch.

When you edit the description, you will see the link url in the url box or you can click on the Actions tab or the Settings &gt; Pages page to find the url to the Quarto website\n\n\n\n\n\nEdit the qmd or md files in the content folder. qmd files can include code (R, Python, Julia) and lots of Quarto markdown bells and whistles (like call-outs, cross-references, auto-citations and much more).\nAdd the files to _quarto.yml\n\n\n\n\nThe most common trouble users run into is that the book is not rendering. Check the following:\n\nThe gh-pages branch does not exist. If you forgot to check the check box to include all the branches when you created the repo from the template then it won’t exist. The Action will fail if the gh-pages branch does not already exist. You can create the branch and then push a change to main to trigger the Action to run again.\nThe GitHub Pages has not been set. You need to go to Pages under settings, and set Pages to build from the gh-pages branch.\nYou did not allow GitHub Actions to run and/or did not give read/write permission.

The PAM SI Team will have representatives from every fisheries center participating in the Openscapes Fall 2024 cohort. This cohort will serve as the backbone of our Open Science effort, and methods developed during the Openscapes project will be detailed in our stand-along Open Science repository. Update: Fall cohort complete, successful development of Lab Manuals (see below).\nLab Manual: Development of a National Lab Manual and a Lab Manual for each Science Center (PIFSC, NEFSC, SEFSC, SWFSC, NWFSC, AFSC). This was be initiated during the Openscapes program, and these serve as a landing page for all information related to the activities of each lab. This will lead to increased transparency and will facilitate information sharing between NOAA Science Centers, outside partners, and the public. Update: All sites created, updates ongoing as of March 2025, expected completion by end of FY26.\nPAM-SI Team Organization : Cross-center collaborations will be organized by teams, with landing pages for each PAM-SI team. This will allow for increased coordination, transparency and information sharing within and outside of these teams. Update: ongoing as of March 2025, expected completion by end of FY26.\nResearch Compendiums: A research compendium is a comprehensive collection of all the digital components related to a research project, including data, code, and text (protocols, reports, metadata, etc). We have developed a research compendium template with set of best practices to encourage standardization of NMFS PAM Research Compendiums. Update: Compendium and best practices completed.\n\n\n\nNotes\nOpen Science for NOAA Fisheries PAM\nAll meeting notes and Openscapes related documents will be accessible in the PAM SI Openscapes Google Drive Folder\nOpenscience discussions are hosted on SAEL’s Openscience Github repository.

A multi-platform comparative sea trial is tentatively planned for FY26 and will provide a means of comparing the utility of various platforms to address different research questions and environmental conditions.\n\n\n\n2. Concurrent Glider/Ship Surveys\n\nUS West Coast CalCurCEAS\nPAM-Gliders may provide cost effective alternatives to seasonal shipboard surveys. We collaborated with Oregon State University to deploy three PAM-gliders off the coast of Oregon. This survey coincided with the periodic CalCurCEAS surveys (conducted once every 5 years) and will provide data to develop downstream methods to assess marine mammal stocks (see PAM-SI Stock Assessment Projects).\n\n\nHawaii HICEAS\nA similar survey will be conducted in early 2026, concurrent with the HICEAS survey in Hawaiian waters. This will serve as a proof of concept and provide critical comparative data for developing stock assessment models.\n\n\n\n3. Advanced Data Analysis\nData collected during the US West Coast surveys will be used by the PAM-SI Stock Assessment team to develop methods for using PAM Glider data for stock assessment models.\n\n\n4. Field Test Ecosystem Studies (UxS funded “Plankton to Whales”)\nThe “Plankton to Whales” (P2W) project is a collaborative project between the PAM-SI and the UxS (uncrewed systems) and Optics Strategic Initiatives. The P2W project transitions PAM-equipped gliders and Shadowgraph-equipped gliders to operational ecological surveys. P2W surveys will begin when after testing of these systems (as soon as summer 2025).\n\n\n5. Transition to Operations Plan –&gt; National Roadmap\nWe are updating developments through our PAM-Glider site and the results of each of these components will result in a Transition to Operations plan. In addition to serving as a research to operations plan for the US West Coast and Hawaii, it will serve as a National Strategy RoadMap for PAM-Glider operations.",

    "text": "PAM GCP Technical System Documentation\nOverview: Summary of key decisions, technical system set-up, and use expectations for using software applications in the PAM GCP. This document is an initial way to collaborate on developing the documentation and will be transitioned to the National PAM Network GitHub once folks have access.\nThe acoustics SI and project design philosophy:\nThe ggn-nmfs-pamdata-prod-1 (“pamdata”) GCP project is designed to encompass the requirements of the PAM SI, while best prioritizing the wants and needs of the end-users and use cases, and staying near best admin practices for NMFS OCIO GCP. The relevant objectives of the PAM acoustics SI include acoustic data storage across NMFS, and passive acoustic monitoring applications that generally feed from this data. The primary end-users of the system include data owners and users, and application owners, developers, and users.\nPermissions structure:\nA principle and role based structure was designed for project capabilities. By defining specific principle groups (project supervisor, application developer, etc) the project is resilient to changes in individual users. Roles are given to these principle groups- for example, the project supervisors principle group is given viewing roles for most of the resources in the project for their visibility.\nFor quick configuration and transparency during the dynamic early stages of the project, principle and role definitions are managed by a central “project admin” principle group via terraform. NMFS OCIO best practice recommends Terraform for more transparent project resource configuration and management, and this allows for simplicity and transparency.\nAlternatives: In the future, we may wish to delegate assignment of users to principle groups in a way that better resembles the true acoustics SI responsible parties (ie, supervisors can assign the project admin(s), data authorities can designate their respective data admin(s), etc). In the short term, this may result in too much unpredictability to the dynamic project.\nBelow are some of the currently defined principles for the project:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrinciple group name\nDefinition and roles\n\n\n\n\nProject admin\nHighest GCP admin role, controls project terraform (all principle, role, resource definitions)\n\n\nProject supervisors\nHighest SI role, has visibility across project resources, tells project admin what to do\n\n\nData authority\nResponsible party for a particular FMC data storage bucket\n\n\nData admin\nAdministrates the contents (write/delete) of a particular storage bucket\n\n\nApplication developer\nAccess to software development resources\n\n\n\nResources:\nThe pamdata project is expected to house PAM data from across NMFS, application development resources, and various applications (&lt;30) in various states of development. Sprawl is a serious threat, in particular since many end-users of the system (owners/authorities, supervisors, users) tend to understand the system through use of a web browser as opposed to filterable api calls. In other words, resource sprawl will lead to reduced understandability of the project across the PAM SI end users and is thus carefully considered.\nData resources:\nEach FMC has a distinct storage bucket for their data. This allows for some flexibility in data naming and easier isolation of permissions between FMCs. Principle groups that are designated here are data authorities (the data owner or responsible party, usually the PI of an FMC acoustics group), and the data admins (the technical users responsible for maintaining the contents of the storage bucket).\nThe browser allows for easy viewing of the storage buckets such that non-technical users can easily interpret the current state of the data across the NMFS FMCs. However, the tool cannot distinguish the FMC buckets from application buckets, and in order to maintain easy interpretability applications will be encouraged to consolidate to fewer buckets as appropriate. Currently, three additional buckets outside of the FMC data buckets exist: the terraform state bucket, an application intermediate bucket, and an application output bucket.\nDevelopment resources:\nThe following resources have been stood up for application development:\nHardened docker image/server: Based on NMFS hardened linux container and preloaded with docker. I developed an imagining pipeline for this, meaning it will be easy to keep up to date and we can make as many copies of this as developers need them. Developing on this instead of locally will be a little closer to cloud and streamlines and simplifies some assumptions. Please make sure any developers working on containers understand this option exists and the advantages in doing development here (hardware flexibility, more similar to production, built in permissions w/o key management, etc).\nDocker registry: This is where container images will be placed (whether we build or import them), and it is a key backbone of a variety of GCP container orchestration services.\nApplication storage buckets: There are two new storage buckets, pamdata-app-intermediates and pamdata-app-outputs. Some of the time applications will need their own specific tiering and lifecycle, but I wanted to start with just these two, especially for early development, given that they are visible along with the FMC data buckets and we tend to like to use the console as a browsing tool to keep track of these. Keeping it to two, and dividing permissions by prefix, will keep the bucket display from getting too muddied.\nNetworking: Created networks and subnets - one for application and development machines, which require ssh and NAT internet connectivity, and one for batch processing, which relies on only private google connectivity by default, but other connectivity can be added as a particular app might need."

All regions will submit and format their humpback detection data into the Passive Acoustic Cetacean Map database.\nThis workflow will allow for a national comparison of one species to be able to identify and compare changes (or lack thereof) within and across regions. Once this structure has been established, these standardized data formats, tools, and environmental data streams can be applied across the range of project goals and regional needs, including regional-specific high-profile species. This project directly supports the PAM SI objective to advance PAM data analysis and integration approaches with an emphasis on addressing long-term trends.\n\n\nAccomplishments\nSpreadsheet of available humpback data",

To start, we will organize different subheadings within this page.\nIdentify Sub-Headings. In this example, we will want to identify different types of Hardware used by our particular lab. In this example, we will want the following categories: “PAM Gliders”, “Drifting Recorders”, “Towed Arrays”, and “Handheld Hydrophones”.\n\nUsing the Source editor, use # to indicate Heading 1 style, ## for Heading 2 Style, etc.\nUsing the Visual editor, use the dropdown menu to select the Heading Style\n\nAdd Content. Most content will consist of text, with some images, hyperlinks, and occasional tables. To start, we recommend identifying the content you would like to put in there, and identify the Point of Contact (POC). As an example, we may put the following text:\nPOC: Jane Doe. General description of Hardware, links to online content (vendor specification page, relevant online content), instructions for build or maintain hardware (or links to that information), links to inventory, etc.\nOnce your outline is developed, fill in the content. IF someone else will collate the content– they can create it in a separate document to be copied/pasted here, or they can directly modify this page.\nIf you find you need separate pages for each sub-heading (instead of one long subheading), then create New Content, and link the new content to the _quarto.yml.\nWhen you are finished modifying your document and Project, push changes to Github using Github Desktop (see instructions here)."
